# Eager Loading and N+1 Prevention

## Load Relations Explicitly

```php
Post::with(['author', 'comments'])->paginate();
```

- Use `load()`/`loadMissing()` after fetching models when needed
- Select only required columns for both base query and relations

## Guard Against Lazy Loading in Dev/Test

Add to a service provider (non-production):

```php
Model::preventLazyLoading(! app()->isProduction());
```

## Verify

- Use a query logger or debugbar to confirm relation queries are minimized
- Add tests that assert counts or avoid unexpected query spikes
